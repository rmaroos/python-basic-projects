## 📂 Projects Included

### 1️⃣ Username Generator
Generates multiple username suggestions based on user input such as name, favorite word, or birth year.  
- **Skills practiced:** strings, input/output, basic logic  

---

### 2️⃣ BMI Calculator
Calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) using user-provided height and weight, then displays the BMI value along with its health category.  
- **Input:** Height (meters), Weight (kg)  
- **Output:** BMI value and category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese)  
- **Skills practiced:** arithmetic operations, conditional statements, input validation  

---

### 3️⃣ Simple Calculator
A **menu-based calculator** that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
- Handles invalid menu choices and non-numeric input  
- Loop-based system allows multiple calculations until the user exits  
- **Skills practiced:** loops, conditional logic, error handling  

---

### 4️⃣ Temperature Converter
Converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit using a **menu-based system**.  
- Converts: Celsius → Fahrenheit and Fahrenheit → Celsius  
- Input validation prevents invalid data  
- Loop allows repeated conversions until exit  
- **Skills practiced:** arithmetic operations, loops, input validation  

---

### 5️⃣ ATM Simulation
Simulates a simple ATM system with **menu-based interaction**.  
- Check current balance  
- Deposit money (with validation for positive amounts)  
- Withdraw money (prevents over-withdrawal and invalid amounts)  
- Loop keeps the program running until the user exits  
- Includes **error handling** for non-numeric input  
- **Skills practiced:** loops, conditional logic, variables, input validation, error handling
